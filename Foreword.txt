As the film swept the world, stories of miracles began to flood in:
people wrote about healing from chronic pain, depression, and
disease; walking for the first time after an accident; even recovering
from a deathbed. We have received thousands of accounts of The Secret
being used to bring about large sums of money and unexpected

checks in the mail. People have used The Secret to manifest their
perfect homes, life partners, cars, jobs, and promotions, with many
accounts of businesses being transformed within days of applying
The Secret. There have been heart-warming stories of stressed relationships
involving children being restored to harmony.
Some of the most magnificent stories we have received have come
from children using The Secret to attract what they want, including
high grades and friends. The Secret has inspired doctors to share
the knowledge with their patients; universities and schools with
their students; health clubs with their clients; churches of all denominations
and spiritual centers with their congregations. There
are Secret parties being held in homes around the world, as people
share the knowledge with loved ones and families. The Secret has
been used to attract all manner of things—from a specific feather
to ten million dollars. All of this has taken place in the few months
since the release of the film.
My intention in creating The Secret was—and still is—that it will
bring joy to billions around the world. The Secret team is experiencing
the realization of that intention every day, as we receive
thousands upon thousands of letters from people across the world,
of all ages, all races/ and all nationalities, expressing gratitude for
the joy of The Secret. There isn't a single thing that you cannot do
with this knowledge. It doesn't matter who you are or where you
are, The Secret can give you whatever you want.
